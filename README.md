**final project for coding** 
Lineart Extractor

**Repository** - https://github.com/AveKnee/holubecAvery_finalProject.git

**Description** - This program will allow users to submit an image of their hand-drawn sketches and have this program automatically remove the background and any noise in the picture to produce a clean, transparent image of just the lineart for use in digital art programs. This will allow users to import their lineart more seamlessly into art programs and allow them to overcome the income barrier of needing a tablet for digital art

**Features** - 
	-changes image to monochromatic scale, making the lineart stand out more 
	-let user pick the color range of their lineart to tell the program what needs to be extracted
	-removes background and creates a new, transparent image of the same size ready to be used as a layer in a digital art program

**Challenges** - I will need to research a color picker, possibly need to learn more about storing and creating new image files, also how to handle transparent images and how to be sure that image quality is not lost when creating new image, resolution will be an important factor. 

**Outcomes** - 
    **Ideal Outcome** - Ideally this project will be fast, simple, and easy to use as a step in the digital art creation process. It will be able to output lineart on a monochromatic scale (lighter pencil lines & darker marks in the same image, not just black lines) and preserve some shading/variety in line weight
    **Minimal Viable Outcome** - The project removes the background produces a transparent png of the darkest parts of an image without much user input, only working within a preset of parameters defined by the program

**Milestones** - 
Implement color picking, be able to consistently upload an image and pick only the desired color
Remove undesired parts of the image that are not within the selected color range
Output a new transparent image file that is the same resolution as the input
